  This is the shared document for data structure. Here one can get the complete implementation of DS in JavaScript, which is handled in a well comprehensive manner. Still many types have to be done, and it is open for all to update.



## Prerequisites

Go to the respective directory(or folder) : like [doublyLinkedList](data-structure-in-javascript/doublyLinkedList)

1) `cd` into the [doublyLinkedList](doublyLinkedList) folder
2) Then run:
```bash
node index.js
```

or in some cases with respective name of index.js file. Like for graphTraversals
run :   
```bash

```
